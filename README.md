## I think the copy is too verbose / technical

1. "The ready to hand over" is not necessary at all
2. "Export to docx/pptx" could be "Export to Word/Powerpoint"
3. "Handy dandy data masker" says nothing to me, a web power user. "Hide sensitive info on screenshoots" is good enaough and understandable
4. "Pure awesomeness" is like saying "Made in China" ... Sorry
5. "You can brand the player with your own logo(s) and skin(s)" ... (s) is unnecesary
6. "Official Rock start status!" ... is unnecesary
